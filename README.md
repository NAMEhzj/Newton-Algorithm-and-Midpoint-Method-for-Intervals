# Newton-Algorithm-for-Intervals

  This repository contains an implementation of the Newton zero-finding method for intervals implemented in Haskell. 
  It also contains two modules "Polynomial" and "Expression" wich can be used to express simple functions and 
  take their derivatives. Note that the newton function only works if the inputs are valid, i.e. the
  second input function is the derivative of the first, and has no zero in the given starting interval. 
  For further details see the comments in the code or "Validated Numerics" by Warwick Tucker, 2011
